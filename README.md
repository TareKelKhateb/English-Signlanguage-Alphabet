# English-Signlanguage-Alphabet
## This project is a real-time English Sign Language (ASL) alphabet classifier that can recognize and classify the 26 letters of the English alphabet using a webcam. The model has been trained on a dataset of approximately 86,000 images of hands representing different letters in ASL. MediaPipe is used to detect and track hands in real-time, allowing the model to focus on classifying the hand signs.
